# Simple PHP XML-RPC Client

I don't use XML-RPC often, and when I do, it's usually for testing a single method. In those cases, I wanted something simple and fast to test with.

After looking, I saw a couple of tools, but most of them seemed more complex than what I really needed/wanted. So, I built this little client to help me with testing XML-RPC calls.

If you find it useful, that's great. Otherwise, I'm happy knowing that it'll make testing a bit easier in the future. :p

Cheers,
